            manipulated or not.
            You may repeat the video, if you want to. <br><br>
            Additionally you need to provide the difficulty of the classification of the video e.g if you had no problems to detect that the video was manipulated select "Easy".
            <br><br>
            The reason you classified the video as manipulated or not-manipulated can be elaborated in an optional text-box.
             <br>
